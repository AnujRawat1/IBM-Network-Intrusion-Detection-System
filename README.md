# 🧠 AI Projects on IBM Cloud Lite

This repository contains two AI-powered solutions developed using IBM Cloud Lite services as part of an end-to-end AI development journey:

## ✅ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A machine learning-based system designed to detect and classify network intrusions (cyberattacks) from traffic data.

### 🚀 Features
- Detects multiple types of cyberattacks: **DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R**
- Achieved **99.5% accuracy** using AutoAI-generated pipelines
- Deployed on IBM Cloud Lite with a fully cloud-based workflow

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Platform:** IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
- **Dataset:** NSL-KDD (Kaggle)
- **Modeling:** AutoAI (XGBoost selected), Scikit-learn
- **Runtime:** Watsonx Runtime
- **Storage:** Watsonx Object Storage
- **Deployment:** IBM Cloud Lite
- **Accuracy:** ✅ 99.5%


## ☁️ Common IBM Cloud Services Used

- **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio** – Development and model training
- **Watsonx Runtime** – Model execution environment
- **Watsonx Object Storage** – Dataset and model artifact storage
- **IBM Cloud Lite** – Lightweight, cloud-native deployment (no local hardware needed)


## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **real-time network traffic analysis** for NIDS via streaming
- Build an interactive **frontend UI** for user-friendly interactions
